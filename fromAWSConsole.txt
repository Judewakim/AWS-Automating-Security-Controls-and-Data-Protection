
Steps
1. configure CloudTrail trail and capture the trail events in CloudWatch logs
-setup CloudTrail trail
-modify the trail to enable the delivery of CloudTrail events to CloudWatch logs

2. create KMS encrypted RDS DB and an EC2 EBS volume
-create DB
-whatever configurations you want
-make sure encryption is checked
-launch instance
-whatever configurations you want
-expand the storage section and make sure the EBS volume is encrypted

3. create CloudWatch logs metric filter and CloudWatch alarm for unencrypted RDS DB
-update the CloudWatch log group to create a metric filter
-use "{ ($.eventSource = "rds.amazonaws.com") && ($.eventName = "CreateDBInstance") && ($.responseElements.storageEncrypted IS FALSE)}" as pattern
-create an alarm
-use the namespace you just created
-The metric parameter should be "sum, 5min, static, greater/equal to, than 1"
-create a new topic and enter your email
-check your email for confirmation of the topic

4. create CloudWatch logs metric filter and CloudWatch alarm for unencrypted EC2 EBS volume
-update the CloudWatch log group to create a metric filter
-use "{ ($.eventSource = "ec2.amazonaws.com") && ($.eventName = "RunInstances") && ( ($.requestParameters.blockDeviceMapping.items[*].ebs.encrypted NOT EXISTS) || ($.requestParameters.blockDeviceMapping.items[*].ebs.encrypted IS FALSE) )}" as pattern
-create an alarm
-use the namespace you just created
-The metric parameter should be "sum, 5min, static, greater/equal to, than 1"
-use the topic you created before

5. create an unencrypted RDS DB and check email for alarm
-create DB
-whatever configurations you want
-make sure encryption is unchecked
-once created, check email

6. create an unencrypted EC2 EBS volume and check email for alarm
-launch instance
-whatever configurations you want
-expand storage section and make sure EBS volume is unencrypted
-once initialized, check email

7. clean up
-delete alarms
-delete log group
-terminate EC2 instances
-delete RDS DBs
